# Milestone 1

##Option 1: 
An idea I had when we did the clock homework was to create some code based on this [“A Perfectly Useless Afternoon” watch](https://mrjoneswatches.com/products/a-perfectly-useless-afternoon). I think it’s charming and since my previous clock didn’t actually map onto a clock face it could be fun to you around with. I’m not sure how to incorporate a physical computing element.

##Option 2a & 2b:
Another idea was to create something similar to our midterm project but with an additional physical component. I’d toyed with several ideas for the midterm such as recreating the Macrodata Refinement software from the show Severance, which is about a fictional corporation called Lumon Industries which creates a technology to split employees into work and non-work selves. The employees in the show work on sorting numbers (based on how scary the numbers feel!) and I could reproduce this via code with a physical button to “box” the numbers (pictured). I also thought about doing something based on the alien/horror film Nope which involves themes of spectacle. Perhaps an animation that uses the ml5.js library to run or not run (perhaps the UFO getting closer or further away) depending on if your eyes are looking at the screen? Again I’m not as sure about the Arduino component… I would love your thoughts on this because I feel like I don’t totally have a sense of what is possible with the Arduino yet. One thing that happens in Nope is that the electricity dies when the UFO is close so the LEDs could die out at a certain point.

##Option 3: 
Earlier in the semester I wrote about this a YouTuber I liked when I was in elementary and middle school called ViHart who considered themself a “mathemusician” and whose doodles seem fun to create in code. I used to draw their [infinity doodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK5Z709J2eo) a lot but they have lots of things like Fibonacci spirals and fractals that I think could be interesting.
